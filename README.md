ML-OCR
======

The goal of this project is to compare and analyze common learning algorithms by applying them to handwritten digit recognition problem. Specifically, SVM, KNN, ANN, decision tree and random forest learning algorithms are used, MNIST data set are utilized as a benchmark. It also aims to provide a reference tutorial on these learning algorithms for beginners. It open sources the project codes in Github and provides overview on these algorithms in terms of both foundational mathematics and intuitive understanding.

Here is the [Project Paper](https://github.com/LevinJ/ML-OCR/blob/master/Handwritten%20Digit%20Recognition%20Project%20Paper.pdf?raw=true).
